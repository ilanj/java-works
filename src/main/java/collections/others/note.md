- Dequeue is a list where every end supports insertion and removal. **(Thread Safe)**
With this feature, it is possible to use the dequeue as a list and a stack at 
the same time as required by the application.

- Priority queue does not have any ends. **( Not Thread Safe)**
In a priority queue, elements can be inserted in any order but removal of the
 elements is in a sorted order.
Due to this behavior, a priority queue can be used to sort the elements.
